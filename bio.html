				<h1>My Biography</h1>
			</header>
			 
			<p>
				I was born in Vung Tau which is a southern city of Vietnam and only about 4 hours driving from Sai Gon city. Shortly after my birth, my family moved to Tra Vinh which is a province in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam. We lived there for a few years and then my family once again moved to another city. This time the destination was Sai Gon where my siblings and I went to night school for a couple of years before we were allowed to attend day school. This was because initially, we were not considered permanent residents of the city.

			<p>
				Sai Gon was the city where we last lived in Vietnam before departing for a temporary life in the Bataan refugee camp in the Philippines. During a little over half a year living in the camp, we went to school to learn about America’s culture and English. Fortunately, immediately after we finished the program, we were sponsored by a very generous and lovely couple to come to America.

				I still remember the first day when we arrived at the Spokane Internal Airport. It was a morning in February, and everything was white on the ground. I was so surprised and clueless about what I saw! After a moment, I learned that it was a snow pile. It looked beautiful but deceivingly cold. This was where my American life and dreams started.

				When living in Spokane, I went to middle school. Every day, I had to look up English words in the English-Vietnamese dictionary. My family tried our hardest time to buy it and brought it along with us during our migration. Studying only 6 months of English did not bring me that far in terms of learning a new language. It was not only me, but everyone in my family did not know English at that time. Thus, without looking up words, I could not understand what the school materials were. When I was in classes, most of the time I could only understand when teachers and classmates greeted me, and I greeted back by saying “Hello” or “Hi”. It was challenging, but it was also wonderful. Everyone whom we met was so nice to us. They tried their best to communicate with us and did so patiently. Without those people and moments, I and my family would not be where we are today. In my heart until today, I am so thankful for meeting them in my life.

				After about 9 months of living in Spokane, my family moved to Boston where I went to high school. My high school was bilingual, so its student population varied among White, Black, Hispanic, Chinese, and Vietnamese. At first, I was very shy and distanced from other students. I remember, there were school lunches that I would sit at one of the stairways instead of joining other students in the cafeteria. One day, a Vietnamese girl approached me, and we talked. Since that moment, we have become best friends. I started to have more friends, open up, and become talkative.

				During my high school years, I also fortunately met a substitute teacher who was in her twenties and the same age as my oldest sister. She loved me so much and was always there when I needed guidance and support. My mother and siblings did not know anything about applying to college and going to college. My substitute teacher helped me with the whole college application process. She brought me to college interviews and taught me how to drive during the summer before I started college. She brought me to the Boston Globe’s interview that was specifically for high school valedictorians. She also took me to Tufts’ campus for my freshman orientation. Thinking back to the moment when she said goodbye to me after dropping me off with other freshmen, I couldn’t stop laughing. In Western culture, specifically America, it is typical that close ones would give each other a hug and a kiss when departing, but I was still not acquainted with the gestures back then. Thus, when she tried to kiss me on my cheek, I was surprised and instinctively pulled myself away from her. Everyone had a fun moment laughing and till today, I have been wondering if I had humiliated her. Of course, I loved her and still love her, there was nothing wrong with her kissing me. It was just a cultural difference; even my mother who loves me so much, but I could not remember if she had ever kissed me. It is also a childish hygienic item that I have overcome over time.

				I spent my next four years at Tufts and majored in both Mathematics and Biochemistry. I was one of the first ones in my family who attend college. This is a fortune for my family that some of us could go to college. My older and younger brothers who are next to me went to college also, but other siblings were not able to do so because they were older when we came to America. Due to the language barrier and economic challenges, they had to start making a living. College life was not as animated as high school life, but I still enjoyed and appreciated the opportunity. I met some new friends, not as many as during high school, but they all became my best friends which was the best part.

				After graduating from college, I was going to continue with school, but in the end, I started my working life until now. During the first few years of my working life, I simultaneously attended school and obtained my Master of Business Administration degree in Technology Management. I thought that I would be done with school, but I decided to start again last fall after 18 years of school-free life. I have been working towards my Master of Science degree in Computer Science and hopefully will graduate by the end of next summer.

				Besides working and schooling, I have also managed to visit a few parts of the world. Those have been my rewards for working hard. I love traveling and experiencing new cultures and foods as well as meeting local people in places that I visit. The experiences nurture my heart and mind.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				This is all about my life so far: a lot of moving, meeting new people - some of whom have left their great marks on my life, learning new things, overcoming challenges, and pursuing dreams.
