1. Implementation:
    a. created 3 html files: resume.html, bio.html and index.hmtl
    b. linked resume.html and bio.html to the index.html
    c. created 3 css files: each is corresponding the above hmtl file

2.  I have completed this lab on my own, but I have researched and visted websites for instructions on items related to html and css 
    information when I am not sure on syntax or which tags, properties, and attributes to use.

3. I did not track the exact time, but I spent a couple hours during a few week nights and several hours on the weekend.  Thus, probably 12-15 hours.
